# Editor
A text editor


### Some ideas to implement
- Build a textbox from scratch without using input or textarea
  - Adding, updating, removing text
  - Implementing cursor ( The way a cursor moves up and down in a normal editor )
- Store the text in an effective data structure
  - Rope, Gap buffer, Piece Table
- Undo tree
- Word wrapping
- Copy pasting lines and files
- Vim motions (optional) (If we can build extensions on top of this then this can be an extension)
